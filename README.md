# Files

* [LogglySteps.zip](LogglySteps.zip) - Workflow zip file with the step and example flow
* [solarwinds.png](/solarwinds.png) - Solarwinds logo

# How it works
These steps follow what is provided in the documentation for [sending](https://documentation.solarwinds.com/en/Success_Center/loggly/Content/admin/api-sending-data.htm) and [retrieving](https://documentation.solarwinds.com/en/Success_Center/loggly/Content/admin/api-retrieving-data.htm) data.


# Installation

## Loggly Setup
For retrieving data this only requires having a Loggly account.

For sending data you will need a customer token (not an API Token). Follow [these](https://documentation.solarwinds.com/en/Success_Center/loggly/Content/admin/customer-token-authentication-token.htm) instructions provided by Solarwinds to find a token. Store this value in an xMatters constant and then provide the constant in the Token input of the **Loggly - Send Data** step.

## xMatters Setup
1. Download the [LogglySteps.zip](LogglySteps.zip) file onto your local computer
2. Navigate to the Workflows tab of your xMatters instance
3. Click Import, and select the zip file you just downloaded

For using the **Loggly - Retrieve Data** step:
1. Create an Endpoint with the Basic Authentication type that connects to loggly. The URL Should be formed like so: `https://<account>.loggly.com`. This should be the start of the URL when using Loggly normally.

For using the **Loggly - Send Data** step:
1. Create an Endpoint with no authentication that has the base URL `https://logs-01.loggly.com`


## Usage
Make sure you've created the appropriate endpoint for the step you are using. Find the instructions above in the **xMatters Setup**.
